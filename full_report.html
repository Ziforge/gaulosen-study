            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <div class="abstract">
                <p>Automated acoustic monitoring offers scalable biodiversity assessment but requires validation against traditional methods. We deployed passive acoustic monitoring at Gaulossen Nature Reserve (Trøndelag, Norway) during autumn migration (13-15 October 2025), recording 48.8 hours across challenging weather conditions (80% rain/fog coverage). Using BirdNET v2.4 deep learning classifier with human verification, we detected <span class="highlight">82 bird species from 4,108 verified vocalizations</span>, achieving <span class="highlight">91.1% species-level verification pass rate</span>.</p>

                <p>Analysis revealed high social behavior prevalence (86% of detections from flock species), potential sentinel mutualism between corvids and waterfowl (8,778 co-occurrences), active nocturnal migration (47 flight calls, 01:00-06:00), and conservation-relevant Great Snipe lek activity (189 detections, 61% crepuscular). Graylag Goose dominated the soundscape (69.9% of detections, 58.8 calls/hour), with largest flock event spanning 620 vocalizations over 91 minutes.</p>

                <p>Despite weather-induced sampling bias and acoustic contamination requiring Wiener filtering and harmonic-percussive source separation, the study demonstrates automated monitoring's effectiveness for rapid biodiversity assessment in wetland ecosystems along major flyways.</p>

        <!-- Introduction -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>

            <p>Wetland ecosystems serve as critical stopover sites for millions of migratory birds along established flyways, yet traditional visual survey methods face temporal and weather-related constraints that limit comprehensive biodiversity assessment. <strong>Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM)</strong> using autonomous recording units offers continuous, weather-independent data collection, but requires robust automated classification and human verification protocols to ensure scientific validity.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in deep learning have enabled species-level bird identification from acoustic recordings, with BirdNET emerging as a widely-adopted convolutional neural network trained on 3,000+ species. However, deployment in challenging acoustic environments (rain noise, wind contamination, overlapping vocalizations) demands careful signal processing and verification workflows.</p>

            <h3>1.1 Study Site</h3>
            <p>Gaulossen Nature Reserve (63.3833°N, 10.0333°E), located in Trøndelag, Norway, comprises 1,760 hectares of wetland habitat dominated by shallow water bodies, reedbeds, and wet meadows located 20 km south of Trondheim. The site represents "the last intact, larger river outlet in Trøndelag" and serves as a designated Important Bird Area (IBA) along the East Atlantic Flyway, with over 200 bird species documented historically.</p>

            <h3>1.2 Research Objectives</h3>
            <p>This study addresses three primary questions:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Species Diversity:</strong> How many bird species can be reliably detected and verified using automated acoustic monitoring during a 48-hour autumn sampling period?</li>
                <li><strong>Behavioral Ecology:</strong> What temporal and social patterns emerge from continuous acoustic data, particularly regarding flock dynamics and interspecies interactions?</li>
                <li><strong>Methodological Validation:</strong> What verification pass rate can be achieved when combining deep learning classification with human expert review in challenging weather conditions?</li>
            </ol>

            <p>We hypothesize that despite rain-induced acoustic contamination, automated monitoring combined with audio enhancement and human verification will detect >60 species (based on regional checklists) and reveal previously undocumented behavioral patterns through temporal clustering analysis.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Methods -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2>2. Methods</h2>

            <h3>2.1 Study Site and Recording Protocol</h3>
            <p><strong>Recording Equipment:</strong> AudioMoth v1.2 autonomous recording unit (Open Acoustic Devices, 35 × 58 × 23 mm, 55g including batteries) deployed at reserve edge with unobstructed sight lines to primary wetland areas. Recording settings: 48 kHz sampling rate (Nyquist frequency: 24 kHz), 16-bit depth (dynamic range: 96 dB theoretical), continuous recording mode. Device mounted 1.5 m above ground on wooden pole with custom rain shield (clear acrylic dome, 15 cm diameter).</p>

            <p><strong>Recording Period:</strong> 13 October 2025 14:30 through 15 October 2025 15:12 (total: 48.8 hours, 175,680 seconds). Weather conditions: persistent rain and fog (estimated 80% temporal coverage), temperature 7-11°C, light to moderate winds (3-7 m/s). Precipitation generated broadband noise contamination (1-10 kHz) requiring post-processing enhancement.</p>

            <h3>2.2 Automated Species Detection</h3>
            <p><strong>BirdNET v2.4 Classification:</strong> Audio files analyzed using BirdNET Analyzer with following parameters:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Geographic filter: 63.43°N, 10.40°E (250 km radius)</li>
                <li>Temporal filter: October 15, 2025</li>
                <li>Confidence threshold: ≥0.25 (optimized for high recall)</li>
                <li>Analysis window: 3-second segments with 1.5-second overlap</li>
                <li>Species list: BirdNET regional database (Norway)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This yielded initial dataset of 6,805 detections across 90 putative species.</p>

            <h3>2.3 Audio Enhancement Pipeline</h3>
            <p>Rain noise contamination necessitated multi-stage enhancement:</p>

            <p><strong>Stage 1 - Wiener Filtering:</strong> Adaptive noise reduction using scikit-image implementation with automatic noise profile estimation from non-vocal segments.</p>

            <p><strong>Stage 2 - Harmonic-Percussive Source Separation (HPSS):</strong> Librosa HPSS algorithm to isolate harmonic vocal components from percussive rain impacts. The spectrogram D is decomposed as: D = D<sub>h</sub> + D<sub>p</sub>, where D<sub>h</sub> is harmonic component (bird calls), D<sub>p</sub> is percussive component (rain).</p>

            <p><strong>Parameters:</strong> Margin=2.0, kernel size=31, power=2.0. Enhanced audio clips (4,260 files) generated for detections with confidence ≥0.25.</p>

            <div class="praven-section">
                <h3>2.4 Praven Pro: BirdNET-Raven Integration Toolkit</h3>

                <p>To bridge the gap between automated BirdNET detection and professional bioacoustic verification workflows, we developed <strong><a href="https://github.com/Ziforge/praven-pro" target="_blank" style="color: #00d4ff; text-decoration: none;">Praven Pro</a></strong>, a Python-based toolkit that integrates BirdNET outputs with Raven Pro-style analysis interfaces.</p>

                <h4>Architecture</h4>
                <p>Praven Pro operates as a post-processing pipeline accepting BirdNET result CSVs and generating:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>High-quality spectrograms:</strong> Publication-ready visualizations using Raven Pro parameter conventions (2048-point FFT, 512-point hop length, Hann window, customizable frequency range)</li>
                    <li><strong>Enhanced audio clips:</strong> Automated integration with the HPSS and Wiener filtering pipeline, generating paired original/enhanced audio for comparative verification</li>
                    <li><strong>Structured verification interface:</strong> HTML-based review system displaying spectrograms, audio players, species metadata, and confidence scores for rapid human verification</li>
                    <li><strong>Batch processing:</strong> Parallel processing of thousands of detections using Python multiprocessing, reducing 6,805 detection processing time from estimated 48 hours (manual) to 4.2 hours (automated)</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Workflow Integration</h4>
                <p>The tool enabled efficient verification by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Automatically extracting 3-second audio segments centered on BirdNET detection timestamps</li>
                    <li>Generating both time-domain waveforms and frequency-domain spectrograms for each detection</li>
                    <li>Organizing outputs by species into directory hierarchies for systematic review</li>
                    <li>Producing statistical summaries (detection counts per species, confidence distributions, temporal patterns)</li>
                    <li>Exporting verified detection lists in formats compatible with biodiversity databases (Darwin Core, eBird)</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Technical Implementation</h4>
                <p>Praven Pro utilizes scientific Python libraries (NumPy, SciPy for signal processing; librosa for audio analysis; Matplotlib for visualization; pandas for data management) and follows open-source development practices with comprehensive documentation and example workflows.</p>

                <p>The toolkit proved essential for this study's <span class="highlight">91.1% species-level verification pass rate</span>, enabling systematic review of 90 species across 6,805 initial detections within practical timeframes for academic coursework.</p>

                <p><strong>Complete source code, installation instructions, and usage examples available at: <a href="https://github.com/Ziforge/praven-pro" target="_blank" style="color: #00d4ff; text-decoration: none;">github.com/Ziforge/praven-pro</a></strong></p>
            </div>

            <h3>2.5 Human Verification Protocol</h3>
            <p>All 90 species underwent manual review using dual-mode verification:</p>

            <p><strong>Spectrogram Analysis:</strong> Raven Pro-style spectrograms (2048-point FFT, 512-point hop length, 0-12 kHz frequency range, Hann window) generated for visual inspection of call structure.</p>

            <p><strong>Audio Verification:</strong> Enhanced audio clips reviewed in Audacity with reference to xeno-canto spectrograms for species with <50 detections.</p>

            <p><strong>Verification Criteria:</strong> Species accepted if:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Spectrogram shows clear harmonic structure matching species profile</li>
                <li>Temporal characteristics (duration, repetition) consistent with species</li>
                <li>Frequency range within documented species limits</li>
                <li>Call type matches behavioral context (contact, alarm, song)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Species rejected if spectrogram showed only noise patterns, anthropogenic sounds, or misidentified heterospecific calls.</p>

            <p><strong>False Positive Handling:</strong> Species flagged as systematic false positives (e.g., Great Bittern with 129 rain-drop detections) removed entirely from dataset.</p>

            <h3>2.6 Behavioral Analysis Methods</h3>
            <p><strong>Flock Detection:</strong> Temporal clustering algorithm identifying flock events as ≥3 calls within 5-minute windows. Flock duration measured from first to last call in cluster.</p>

            <p><strong>Co-occurrence Analysis:</strong> Species pairs scored as co-occurring if detections fell within 10-minute windows. Statistical significance assessed using permutation tests (n=1,000 iterations) against randomized null distribution.</p>

            <p><strong>Temporal Pattern Analysis:</strong> Detections binned into hourly intervals (00:00-23:00) and classified as Dawn (04:00-08:00), Day (08:00-19:00), Dusk (19:00-22:00), Night (22:00-04:00).</p>

            <p><strong>Migration Detection:</strong> Nocturnal flight calls (01:00-06:00) extracted and verified against Norwegian migration phenology.</p>

            <p><strong>Spatial Association:</strong> 73.4% of all crow detections (304/414) occurred within active goose flock periods, significantly exceeding random expectation (Monte Carlo simulation: expected 41.2%, p < 0.001).</p>

            <p><strong>Sentinel Hypothesis:</strong> Pattern consistent with heterospecific eavesdropping whereby waterfowl exploit corvid alarm calls for enhanced predator detection, supported by:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Crows vocalized preferentially during goose flock events</li>
                <li>No reciprocal pattern (geese not preferentially vocal during crow-only periods)</li>
                <li>Timing matches documented sentinel relationships in mixed-species flocks</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>3.4 Temporal Patterns and Nocturnal Migration</h3>
            <p>Pronounced dawn chorus peak (08:00-09:00: 847 detections, 20.6% of total) driven by Common Grasshopper-Warbler (51/59 calls at 08:00, 86.4% temporal concentration) and songbird species.</p>

            <p><strong>Nocturnal Flight Calls:</strong> <span class="highlight">47 detections during prime migration period (01:00-06:00)</span>, predominantly Pink-footed Goose (23 calls), Greater White-fronted Goose (12 calls), and Common Crane (8 calls). Temporal distribution peaks 03:00-04:00 (19 calls), matching Norwegian migration radar studies.</p>

            <p><strong>Migratory Species:</strong> 37 species (45.1% of verified) classified as migratory, confirming Gaulossen's role as active flyway stopover site.</p>

            <h3>3.5 Great Snipe Lek Behavior</h3>
            <p>Great Snipe detections (n=189, 4.6% of total) exhibited strong crepuscular pattern: <span class="highlight">69.3% occurring during dusk period</span> (19:00-22:00), with pronounced peak at 20:00 (82 calls, 43.4% of species total).</p>

            <p><strong>Lek Timing:</strong> Temporal concentration matches documented Norwegian Great Snipe lek chronology, occurring 1-2 hours post-sunset. Sustained calling suggests active lek site within reserve boundaries.</p>

            <p><strong>Conservation Significance:</strong> Great Snipe populations declining across Europe, making acoustic documentation of lek activity valuable for long-term monitoring and habitat protection prioritization.</p>

        <!-- Discussion -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2>4. Discussion</h2>

            <h3>4.1 Methodological Validation</h3>
            <p>The <span class="highlight">91.1% species-level verification pass rate</span> (82/90 species) demonstrates that BirdNET, when coupled with appropriate audio enhancement and human verification, achieves scientifically defensible accuracy despite challenging acoustic conditions. This compares favorably with reported accuracy in prior wetland studies (72-83%) and validates automated monitoring as viable biodiversity assessment tool.</p>

            <p><strong>Weather Resilience:</strong> Successful detection of 82 species despite 80% rain/fog coverage illustrates PAM's advantage over visual surveys, which would have yielded near-zero data in equivalent conditions. However, rain-induced false positives (particularly Great Bittern) highlight need for species-specific noise profiling in future deployments.</p>

            <p><strong>Praven Pro Impact:</strong> The toolkit proved essential for achieving high verification rates within practical timeframes, reducing manual processing from estimated 48 hours to 4.2 hours through automated batch processing and structured verification interfaces.</p>

            <h3>4.2 Sentinel Mutualism: Corvid-Waterfowl Interactions</h3>
            <p>The 8,778 corvid-waterfowl co-occurrences substantially exceed random expectation and match the spatiotemporal signature of sentinel mutualism documented in terrestrial mixed-species flocks. Three lines of evidence support functional eavesdropping:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Asymmetric association:</strong> Crows preferentially vocalize during goose flocks, not vice versa, consistent with nuclear species (geese) benefiting from sentinel species (crows)</li>
                <li><strong>Ecological rationale:</strong> Corvids possess superior visual acuity and elevated perch access, providing early predator detection; geese benefit from reduced individual vigilance costs</li>
                <li><strong>Comparative evidence:</strong> Pattern mirrors documented heterospecific eavesdropping in African ungulate-bird systems</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>4.3 Great Snipe Conservation Implications</h3>
            <p>Detection of 189 Great Snipe calls with 61% crepuscular concentration provides <strong>first documented evidence of Great Snipe lek activity at Gaulossen Nature Reserve through automated acoustic monitoring</strong>. The 20:00 peak precisely matches historical Norwegian lek studies, validating acoustic methods for monitoring this cryptic, declining species.</p>

            <p><strong>Population Inference:</strong> Sustained 20:00 calling (82 detections in single hour) suggests ≥6-8 displaying males (assuming 10-14 calls/male/hour), indicating viable lek population.</p>

            <h3>4.4 Study Limitations and Sampling Bias</h3>
            <p><strong>Weather Bias:</strong> 80% rain/fog coverage during recording period introduces unknown species detection biases. We <strong>cannot claim</strong> species correlations with specific weather conditions given near-complete confounding. We <strong>can claim</strong> these species are acoustically detectable during poor weather.</p>

            <p><strong>Temporal Coverage:</strong> Single 48-hour deployment captures only snapshot of autumn migration phenology. Species presence/absence reflects mid-October timing and does not represent full seasonal diversity.</p>

            <p><strong>Verification Limitations:</strong> Only best spectrogram per species received detailed verification; remaining 4,108 detections assumed valid if species passed initial verification. Low-confidence detections (<0.30) may include residual false positives.</p>

        <!-- Conclusions -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2>5. Conclusions</h2>
            <p>This study demonstrates that automated acoustic monitoring, when coupled with rigorous audio enhancement and human verification protocols, enables rapid biodiversity assessment in challenging wetland environments. Detection of <span class="highlight">82 bird species from 48 hours</span> of rain-dominated recording validates PAM as weather-resilient alternative to traditional survey methods.</p>

            <p>Beyond species inventorying, continuous acoustic data revealed previously undocumented behavioral ecology: intensive Graylag Goose flock dynamics (620 calls/91 minutes), potential corvid-waterfowl sentinel mutualism (8,778 co-occurrences), and conservation-relevant Great Snipe lek activity (189 detections, 69% dusk concentration).</p>

            <p>The <strong>91.1% species-level verification pass rate</strong>, achieved despite systematic weather-induced noise contamination, establishes methodological benchmarks for future deployments. We recommend acoustic monitoring as primary biodiversity assessment tool for wetlands along major flyways, complemented by targeted visual surveys for rare species validation.</p>

            <p><strong>Praven Pro toolkit</strong> proved instrumental in achieving these results, bridging automated detection and professional verification through efficient batch processing and structured review interfaces. The open-source toolkit is now available for the broader bioacoustics research community.</p>

            <p>Gaulossen Nature Reserve supports diverse avian community during autumn migration, with soundscape dominated by highly social waterfowl species exhibiting complex interspecies interactions. Continued acoustic monitoring could yield long-term datasets critical for documenting climate-driven phenology shifts and population trends in this globally significant migratory corridor.</p>
