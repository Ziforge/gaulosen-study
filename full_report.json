  "abstract": {
    "background": "Passive acoustic monitoring provides non-invasive, continuous assessment of avian communities. We deployed autonomous recording units at Gaulossen Nature Reserve to document species composition and behavioral patterns.",
    "methods": "48.8 hours of continuous audio recording (October 13-15, 2025) analyzed using BirdNET v2.4 deep learning classifier with manual verification of all species detections.",
    "results": "Detected 90 species with 82 verified (91.1% verification rate). Dominant species: Graylag Goose (2,871 calls), Spotted Crake (2,556 calls). Documented 756 nocturnal flight calls, 150 interspecies call-response pairs, and 5 multi-species alarm cascades.",
    "conclusions": "Gaulossen supports remarkably diverse wetland avifauna including rare species (Great Snipe leks). High social coordination evident through call-response networks and alarm cascades. Active nocturnal migration corridor documented."
