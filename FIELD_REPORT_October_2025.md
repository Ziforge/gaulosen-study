**Initial Observations (11:37-17:30):**

**Systematic Observation Log:**

| Time | Species Observed | Activity | Visual Count | Audible Calls | Behavior Notes |
|------|------------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| 11:37 | Multiple waterfowl | Foraging | ~50-100 | Frequent | Deployment initiated |
| 12:30 | Graylag Goose | Flock calling | ~200 | Continuous | High vocal activity |
| 14:00 | Hooded Crow | Perching/calling | 3-5 | Intermittent | Near goose flock |
| 16:00 | Graylag Goose | **PEAK EVENT** | **200+** | **Extreme** | 91-min continuous calling |
| 17:00 | Multiple corvids | Flying/calling | 5-10 | Frequent | Mixed flock behavior |
| 17:26 | Graylag peak ends | Dispersal | Decreasing | Diminishing | Flock event concludes |

**Key Species Documented:**

- **Graylag Goose** (*Anser anser*): Pronounced flock calling throughout afternoon. Largest acoustic event 16:00-17:26 (91 minutes continuous calling, 620 individual vocalizations detected post-analysis). Flock estimated 200+ individuals based on visual observation and acoustic intensity. This event represents 21.6% of all Graylag detections in 1.9% of recording time (extreme concentration).

- **Corvid Activity:** Hooded Crow (*Corvus cornix*) and Carrion Crow (*C. corone*) frequently calling in proximity to goose flocks, consistent with sentinel mutualism behavior pattern. Estimated 5-10 individuals perching on fence posts and trees adjacent to wetland.

- **Great Snipe** (*Gallinago media*): Crepuscular activity beginning 19:00, peaking 20:00-21:00. Autumn migration stopover calls (contact/foraging), not spring lek displays. 82 calls detected at 20:00 peak. No visual confirmation (cryptic species, poor visibility).

**Acoustic Environment Assessment:**
- **Primary Signal:** Avian vocalizations (Graylag dominant)
- **Primary Noise:** Rain impact on microphone and surfaces
- **Secondary Noise:** Wind rustling (minimal), distant traffic (occasional)
- **SNR Estimate:** Moderate to poor (rain-limited)
- **Post-Processing Required:** Extensive noise reduction (Wiener filtering + harmonic-percussive source separation planned)

### Evening Observations (18:00-23:59)

**Crepuscular Activity Peak (19:00-22:00):**
- Great Snipe migration calls dominating dusk period
- Eurasian Woodcock (*Scolopax rusticola*) roding flights detected acoustically
- Common Grasshopper-Warbler (*Locustella naevia*) minimal evening activity (species shows strong dawn specialization per later analysis)

**Nocturnal Period (23:00+):**
- Tawny Owl (*Strix aluco*) territorial hooting
- Mallard (*Anas platyrhynchos*) nocturnal social calls (species shows 59% nocturnal activity - biologically valid for ducks)
- Limited nocturnal migration flight calls (peak occurs 02:00-05:00 per post-analysis)

**Weather:** Rain continuing throughout night, fog persisting

## Day 2: October 14, 2025

### Morning Observations (06:00-12:00)

**Weather Conditions:**

| Time | Temp (°C) | Conditions | Wind | Visibility | Precip | Notes |
|------|-----------|------------|------|------------|--------|-------|
| 06:00 | 8 | Heavy fog, overcast | Calm | <200m | Mist | Pre-dawn period |
| 08:00 | 9 | Fog, intermittent rain | Light | ~500m | Light rain | Dawn chorus peak |
| 10:00 | 10 | Rain, fog clearing | Light NW | ~1km | Intermittent | Improved visibility |
| 12:00 | 11 | Overcast, light rain | Moderate | ~1.5km | Drizzle | Midday conditions |

**Summary:** Fog-dominated morning with gradual visibility improvement. Dawn chorus despite poor conditions. Temperature range: 8-11°C.

**Dawn Chorus (06:00-09:00):**

**Systematic Observation Log:**

| Time | Species Observed | Activity | Visual Count | Audible Calls | Behavior Notes |
|------|------------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| 06:00 | Limited visibility | N/A | N/A | Occasional | Heavy fog, pre-dawn |
| 07:00 | Woodcock (heard) | Roding flights | Not seen | Frequent | Distinctive calls |
| 08:00 | Grasshopper-Warbler | **DAWN PEAK** | Not seen | **Intense** | Continuous reeling |
| 08:00 | Waterfowl | Foraging | ~100-150 | Moderate | Flock activity |
| 09:00 | Mixed species | General activity | Variable | Moderate | Fog beginning to lift |

**Key Dawn Activity:**

- **Common Grasshopper-Warbler** (*Locustella naevia*): Intense reeling trill 08:00 (51 calls in single hour - 86% of total daily detections, 98% of calls at dawn). Classic dawn chorus territorial singing. Mechanical, insect-like continuous trill. No visual confirmation - cryptic species in dense vegetation.

- **Eurasian Woodcock** (*Scolopax rusticola*): Roding flight displays 07:00-08:00 peak (31 calls detected at 08:00). Distinctive croaking and whistling calls audible above rain noise. Crepuscular specialist (75% of detections dawn/dusk periods).

- **Corvid-Waterfowl Interactions:** Continued co-occurrence patterns suggesting heterospecific eavesdropping (8,778 total co-occurrences within 10-minute windows detected post-analysis). Visual observations confirm corvids perching near waterfowl foraging areas.

**Habitat Assessment:**
Reserve functioning as active migration stopover. Wetland providing:
- Foraging habitat (shallow water invertebrates)
- Roosting areas (reedbeds, open water)
- Refuge from predation (open sight lines, corvid sentinels)

## Post-Deployment Analysis Summary

### Automated Classification (BirdNET v2.4)
- **Initial detections:** 90 species, 6,805 total detections
- **After human verification:** 82 species, 4,108 detections (91.1% species pass rate)
- **After biological screening:** 77 species, 4,085 detections (85.6% final pass rate)

### Species Rejected During Quality Control
1. Lesser Spotted Woodpecker (14): Nocturnal activity biologically impossible
2. European Storm-Petrel (4): Oceanic species inland impossible
3. Manx Shearwater (3): Pelagic species habitat impossibility
4. Western Capercaillie (1): Rain noise mimicking forest grouse
5. Bar-headed Goose (1): Central Asian species - likely escaped bird
6. 8 additional species rejected during initial verification (including 129 Great Bittern false positives from rain noise)

### Key Behavioral Findings

**1. Social Behavior Dominance**
- 86% of detections from flock/social species
- Graylag Goose: 98.7% of calls in flocks (59 discrete flock events)
- Largest flock: 620 calls over 91 minutes

**2. Corvid-Waterfowl Sentinel Mutualism**
- 8,778 geese-crow co-occurrences within 10-minute windows
- Pattern consistent with heterospecific eavesdropping
- Crows providing early warning, geese benefiting from enhanced predator detection

**3. Migration Documentation**
- 37 migratory species detected (45% of verified species)
- 47 nocturnal flight calls documenting active flyway passage
- Great Snipe: 189 detections representing autumn stopover (NOT lek behavior - leks occur April-May)

**4. Temporal Specialization**
- Common Grasshopper-Warbler: 98% dawn activity
- Great Snipe: 61% crepuscular (69% dusk-only)
- Mallard: 59% nocturnal (biologically valid for ducks)

## Conservation Implications

**Gaulossen as Critical Stopover Habitat:**
1. **Species Diversity:** 77 verified species in 48.8 hours demonstrates high biodiversity
2. **Declining Species Present:** Great Snipe, Corn Crake, River Warbler (rare vagrant)
3. **Flyway Importance:** Nocturnal migration calls confirm active East Atlantic Flyway corridor
4. **Habitat Quality:** High social species concentration indicates productive foraging habitat

**Passive Acoustic Monitoring Value:**
- Weather-independent data collection (visual surveys impossible during fog/rain)
- 24-hour coverage capturing nocturnal/crepuscular species
- Permanent acoustic archive for future reference
- Non-invasive methodology suitable for sensitive species

---

## Challenges and Lessons Learned

### Weather-Related Issues
- **Rain noise contamination:** Required extensive post-processing (Wiener filtering, HPSS)
- **Sampling bias:** Cannot claim weather correlations - 80%+ recording during rain/fog
- **Great Bittern false positives:** 129 detections from rain impact noise (70-91% confidence scores)

### Methodological Improvements for Future Deployments
1. **Multiple recorders:** Deploy 2-3 units for spatial redundancy
2. **Weather monitoring:** Co-deploy weather station for correlation analysis
3. **Longer deployment:** Extend to 7+ days for temporal robustness
4. **Seasonal comparison:** Repeat spring deployment to capture breeding season vs. migration

### Equipment Performance
- AudioMoth v1.2 performed excellently in adverse conditions
- Waterproof housing critical for wet-weather deployments
- Battery life exceeded 48 hours continuous recording
- Memory card capacity adequate for extended deployment
