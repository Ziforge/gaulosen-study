# Species Biological Verification Summary

**Date:** October 21, 2025
**Analyst:** Systematic biological plausibility review
**Purpose:** Verify all 82 detected species against geographic range, seasonal timing, and behavioral biology

---

## Executive Summary

**Original Dataset:**
- 82 species
- 4,108 verified detections

**After Biological Verification:**
- **REMOVED:** 3 species, 21 detections (biologically impossible)
- **NEEDS HUMAN REVIEW:** 7 species, 10 detections
- **REVISED DATASET:** 79 species, 4,087 detections (99.5% retained)

---

## Species Removed (Biologically Impossible)

### 1. Lesser Spotted Woodpecker - **14 detections REJECTED**

**Issue:** Claimed 71% nocturnal activity

**Evidence Against:**
- Woodpeckers are **strictly diurnal** birds
- "Active during the day and rest at night" (confirmed multiple ornithological sources)
- "At night they roost in old holes" (nest cavities)
- 71% nocturnal activity is **biologically impossible**

**Verdict:** All 14 detections are rain noise or misidentified species. REMOVE COMPLETELY.

---

### 2. European Storm-Petrel - **4 detections REJECTED**

**Issue:** Oceanic seabird detected 100m inland at wetland

**Evidence Against:**
- "Strictly oceanic outside breeding season"
- Breeds on exposed islands
- "Rarely seen from land except in autumn storms"
- Pelagic species, never in inland wetland habitat

**Verdict:** Impossible habitat. All 4 detections are false positives. REMOVE COMPLETELY.

---

### 3. Manx Shearwater - **3 detections REJECTED**

**Issue:** Oceanic seabird detected inland

**Evidence Against:**
- Strictly pelagic/oceanic species
- Never found in inland wetland habitats
- Same biological impossibility as Storm-Petrel

**Verdict:** All 3 detections are false positives. REMOVE COMPLETELY.

---

## Species Requiring Human Verification (7 species, 10 detections)

### Priority 1: LIKELY INVALID

**1. Bar-headed Goose (1 detection)**
- **Natural range:** Central Asia (breeds), South Asia (winters)
- **Norway status:** Historical escaped population 1950s-60s
- **Verdict:** Single detection likely escaped/introduced bird
- **Action:** Review spectrogram - reject unless clearly part of wild population

**2. Black-legged Kittiwake (1 detection)**
- **Natural range:** Coastal/oceanic
- **Issue:** Rare inland
- **Verdict:** Could be storm-driven October 13-15
- **Action:** Check if storm conditions during recording. If no storm, reject.

---

### Priority 2: HABITAT/RANGE QUESTIONABLE

**3. Western Capercaillie (1 detection)**
- **Natural range:** Norway (common)
- **Habitat:** Old-growth coniferous forest (NOT wetland)
- **Possible exception:** Broods use forests near peat bogs
- **Action:** Check if forested edge near deployment site. If yes, possible. If no, reject.

**4. Arctic Warbler (4 detections)**
- **Status:** Rare in western Norway
- **Issue:** 4 detections suggests either real passage OR systematic misID
- **Action:** Review all 4 spectrograms for consistency. Could be confused with other Phylloscopus warblers.

---

### Priority 3: RARE BUT PLAUSIBLE

**5. Richard's Pipit (1 detection) - LIKELY VALID ✓**
- **Status:** Regular vagrant to Scandinavia
- **Timing:** "Seen annually September-November, peak October"
- **Recent records:** 12 in Britain Oct 2024, others in Norway/Sweden
- **Verdict:** October 13-15 timing is **PERFECT** for this species
- **Action:** Review for confirmation, but **likely valid**

**6. River Warbler (1 detection) - HIGH VALUE IF REAL**
- **Status:** Very rare vagrant to western Europe
- **Timing:** Records in late spring and autumn (October plausible)
- **Value:** If verified, this is a valuable sighting for Norwegian records
- **Action:** Careful spectrogram review. Distinctive song/call pattern.

**7. Corn Crake (1 detection)**
- **Status:** Declining, secretive species
- **Range:** Occurs in Norway
- **Timing:** October migration plausible
- **Value:** If detected acoustically, valuable conservation record
- **Action:** Review spectrogram quality. Distinctive rasping call.

---

## Additional Species Verified as VALID

**Mallard (27 detections, 59% nocturnal)**
- **Claimed issue:** High nocturnal activity
- **Evidence FOR validity:**
  - "Mallards flexibly allocate activity over day and night"
  - "Feed at night especially in winter and disturbed areas"
  - "Many duck species are mainly active at night"
- **Verdict:** **VALID** - nocturnal feeding behavior is well-documented

**Great Snipe (189 detections, 69% dusk)**
- **Previously claimed:** Lek behavior (INCORRECT)
- **Corrected interpretation:** Autumn migration stopover
- **Timing:** October is autumn migration, NOT spring lek season (April-May)
- **Verdict:** **VALID** - but behavioral interpretation corrected

## Biological Verification Criteria Used

1. **Geographic Range**
   - Does species occur in Norway?
   - Is October within migration window?

2. **Habitat Match**
   - Is wetland appropriate habitat?
   - Could species be in adjacent habitats?

3. **Temporal Plausibility**
   - Does time-of-day match known biology?
   - Diurnal species should NOT be nocturnal

4. **Vagrancy Patterns**
   - For rare species: are October vagrants documented?
   - Check recent records for validation
