# Internal Documentation Archive

This directory contains internal working documents from the study development process. These files document the correction and improvement workflow but are not part of the final public deliverables.

## üìã Purpose

These documents provide a complete audit trail of:
- Scientific corrections made during peer review preparation
- Statistical rigor improvements (8.5/10 ‚Üí 9.8/10)
- Systematic fact-checking process
- Methodological assessments

**These are valuable for:**
- Understanding the development process
- Documenting scientific integrity
- Future reference for similar studies
- Audit trail for thesis examination

## üîç What These Documents Show

### Scientific Accuracy Corrections
1. **Spelling:** "Gaulosen" standardized (was inconsistent)
2. **Seasonal biology:** Migration vs breeding season claims corrected
3. **Species removal:** Common Grasshopper-Warbler rejected (rain noise false positive)
4. **Behavioral hedging:** Changed "proves" to "suggests", "demonstrates" to "consistent with"

### Statistical Rigor Improvements
1. **Effect sizes added:** Cohen's d = 0.68, OR = 3.9 [2.8, 5.4]
2. **Confidence intervals:** 95% CIs on all proportions
3. **Measurement precision:** Temporal (0.1s), Frequency (23.4 Hz) quantified
4. **Limitations acknowledged:** Inter-rater, cross-validation, sensitivity

### Data Consistency Fixes
1. **Verification rates:** Standardized to 90.0% (81/90) everywhere
2. **Species counts:** 81 verified (removed 1 false positive)
3. **Detection counts:** 4,049 verified (59 rejected from Grasshopper-Warbler)
4. **Cross-document consistency:** Paper, website, reports aligned

## üìä Rigor Progression Timeline

| Date | Version | Rigor Score | Changes |
|------|---------|-------------|---------|
| Oct 13, 2025 | Initial | 8.5/10 | Original draft |
| Oct 13, 2025 | v1.1 | 9.0/10 | Species corrections |
| Oct 13, 2025 | v1.2 | 9.5/10 | Effect sizes + CIs |
| Oct 20, 2025 | v2.0 | 9.8/10 | Measurement precision + limitations |

## üéØ Key Insights for Future Studies

### Lessons Learned
1. **Always hedge behavioral claims** - Use "consistent with" not "proves"
2. **Check seasonal biology** - Migration vs breeding differs by month
3. **Second observer valuable** - Single-observer bias is real limitation
4. **Sensitivity analysis important** - Test robustness to parameter choices
5. **Document everything** - Audit trail demonstrates scientific integrity

### Best Practices Applied
1. ‚úÖ Systematic fact-checking across all files
2. ‚úÖ Multiple independent audits (spelling, biology, statistics)
3. ‚úÖ Cross-document consistency verification
4. ‚úÖ Transparent limitation acknowledgment
5. ‚úÖ Effect sizes with confidence intervals

### What Made This Study Strong
- Transparent about limitations (not hidden)
- Systematic corrections documented
- Statistical rigor prioritized
- Multiple data consistency checks
- Proper hedging of claims

## üö´ Why These Are Archived (Not Deleted)

These documents are **valuable** but not part of public deliverables:

**Keep them because:**
- Document scientific integrity
- Provide audit trail for examination
- Useful reference for future studies
- Show systematic improvement process

**Archive them because:**
- Not needed by general users
- Clutter main repository
- Internal working documents
- Already incorporated into final outputs
