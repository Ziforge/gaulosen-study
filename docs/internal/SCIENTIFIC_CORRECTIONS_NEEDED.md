# Scientific Corrections Required - Seasonal & Behavioral Claims

**Study Period:** October 13-15, 2025 (AUTUMN MIGRATION SEASON)

## Critical Errors Identified

### 1. Great Snipe "Lek Behavior" ❌ INCORRECT

**Current Claims:**
- "Great Snipe lek behavior" / "lek displays" / "lek activity"
- "Gaulosen may support breeding population"
- "6-8 displaying males" suggesting viable lek population
- "First documented evidence of Great Snipe lek activity"

**Reality:**
- Great Snipes breed **May-June** in Scandinavia (spring/summer)
- October = **MIGRATION SEASON** (Arctic → Africa)
- These are **migration stopover calls**, NOT lek displays
- Misapplying Kålås et al. (1995) breeding study to migration context

**Correct Interpretation:**
- "Great Snipe migration stopover calls"
- "Dusk calling during autumn migration"
- "Important stopover site along migration route"
- Remove ALL "lek", "breeding", "displaying males" language

---

### 2. Eurasian Woodcock "Roding Flights" ❌ INCORRECT

**Current Claims:**
- "Roding flights" (territorial breeding display)
- "Display flights over territory"
- "Indicates suitable breeding/foraging habitat"

**Reality:**
- Roding is a **breeding display** (March-July)
- October = **MIGRATION SEASON**
- These are migration calls, NOT territorial displays

**Correct Interpretation:**
- "Crepuscular calling during migration"
- "Dawn/dusk activity at stopover site"
- Remove "roding" and "territorial" language

### 3. Common Grasshopper-Warbler "Dawn Chorus Territorial Singing" ❌ INCORRECT

**Current Claims:**
- "Dawn chorus territorial singing"
- "Males defending territories through vocal display"
- "Territorial dawn singing"

**Reality:**
- Breeds **May-July** in Europe
- By October, migrating to **Sub-Saharan Africa**
- These are migration calls, NOT territorial singing

**Correct Interpretation:**
- "Dawn calling during migration"
- "Stopover vocalizations"
- Remove ALL "territorial", "defending territories", "dawn chorus" language

---

### 4. Mallard "Nocturnal Species" ❌ INCORRECT

**Current Claims:**
- "Mallard (59% nocturnal)"
- Listed under "Nocturnal Species" section
- "Consistent with waterfowl nocturnal feeding behavior"

**Reality:**
- Mallards are **DIURNAL** (daytime active)
- Just happened to be detected at night in this study
- **Sampling bias**, not species behavior

**Correct Interpretation:**
- "Mallard detected primarily at night (sampling artifact)"
- Move to general species list, NOT "nocturnal species"
- Add sampling bias warning

---

### 5. Tawny Owl "Territorial Hooting" ✅ ACCEPTABLE

**Current Claims:**
- "Territorial hooting"

**Assessment:**
- Tawny Owls are **resident** and territorial **year-round**
- October territorial calling is biologically appropriate
- This claim is **CORRECT**

## Required Changes

### Files to Update:
1. `index.html` - Homepage claims
2. `behavioral_findings.html` - Behavioral findings page
3. `full_report.html` - Full scientific report
4. `BEHAVIORAL_FINDINGS_REPORT.md` - Markdown report
5. `SCIENTIFIC_REFERENCES.md` - References and validation
6. `latex_paper/gaulosen_paper.tex` - LaTeX paper (if exists)
7. `README.md` - Summary claims

### Global Find/Replace Needed:
- "Great Snipe lek" → "Great Snipe migration calls"
- "lek behavior" → "migration stopover behavior"
- "breeding population" → "migration stopover population"
- "displaying males" → "calling individuals"
- "roding flights" → "crepuscular calling"
- "dawn chorus territorial singing" → "dawn calling during migration"
- "males defending territories" → "migratory individuals calling"
- "Nocturnal Species" section → "Species Detected Primarily at Night (Sampling Artifact)"

### Add Sampling Bias Warnings:
- October = autumn migration, NOT breeding season
- Time-of-day patterns reflect sampling period, not necessarily species ecology
- Cannot infer territorial or breeding behavior from autumn migration data
