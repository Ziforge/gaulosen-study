## Two-Phase Correction Process

### PHASE 1: Major Systematic Issues (Commit 6c9b073)

**Critical Issues Fixed:**
1. Verification rate inconsistencies (91.1%, 87.8%, 90.0%)
2. "Previously undocumented" overclaims
3. Sample size overgeneralization

**Medium Priority Fixed:**
4. Statistical methodology not described
5. Verification protocol ambiguity

**Low Priority Fixed:**
6. Individual identification limitations

**Files Modified:** 9 files, 744 insertions, 48 deletions

---

### PHASE 2: Critical Oversights (Commit 4e61760)

**Critical Oversights Found & Fixed:**

#### 1. Common Grasshopper-Warbler Contradiction (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** Species was explicitly REJECTED as false positive (GRASSHOPPER_WARBLER_REJECTION.md) but still appeared throughout LaTeX paper as verified species.

**Locations Fixed:**
- ‚ùå Line 276: Listed as "Notable detection" ‚Üí **REMOVED**
- ‚ùå Line 304: "driven by Common Grasshopper-Warbler (51/59 calls...)" ‚Üí **REPLACED** with "driven by songbird species"
- ‚ùå Line 478: In species table ‚Üí **REMOVED**
- ‚ùå Line 510: Figure caption reference ‚Üí **REMOVED**
- ‚ùå Line 543: Spectrogram figure ‚Üí **REPLACED** with Eurasian Woodcock

**Impact:** Major contradiction eliminated - paper now consistent with rejection decision.

#### 2. Text Duplication Bug (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** "pattern consistent with pattern consistent with sentinel mutualism hypothesis hypothesis" appeared in 2 locations.

**Fixed:**
- Abstract line 47: Removed duplication ‚Üí "corvid-waterfowl co-occurrence pattern consistent with sentinel mutualism hypothesis"
- Figure caption line 521: Removed duplication

**Impact:** Professional presentation restored.

#### 3. Social Species Percentage (MEDIUM)
**Problem:** Stated "86% of detections from flock species" but actual = 87.2%

**Calculation:** 3,533 / 4,049 = 87.25% ‚âà 87%

**Files Updated:**
- latex_paper/gaulossen_paper.tex (abstract)
- index.html
- behavioral_findings.html
- BEHAVIORAL_FINDINGS_REPORT.md (2 instances)

Also updated: Graylag Goose 69.9% ‚Üí 70.9% (2,871/4,049)

**Impact:** Mathematical accuracy restored.
